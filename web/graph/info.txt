In the $Forgery$ game, the gamemaster runs $Gen \\rightarrow (pk, sk)$ and then gives $A$ oracle access to $Sign_{sk}$.  Eventually, $A$ will output a challenge message-signature pair $m^\\star, \\sigma^\\star$, and $A$ wins the game if $Ver_{pk}(m^\\star, \\sigma^\\star)$ returns $Accept$ (and $m^\\star$ was not queried to the $Sign_{pk}$ oracle)."

Each family $F_n$ is itself a collection of functions $F_n = \\{f_k\\}_{k \\in K_n}$ keyed by a key $k$ chosen from $K_n$.  Each pseudorandom function $f_k$ has the following properties:\n(1) Poly-time evaluation.  There exists an algorithm that is polynomial time in $n$ such that for $n \\ge 1$, for $k \\in K_n$, and input $x$ (typically from $\\{0,1\\}^n$) that computes $f_k(x)$, and\n(2) Pseudorandomness.  No probabilistic adversary that runs in time polynomial in $n$ can distinguish $f_k(x)$ for a *randomly chosen $k$ unknown to the adversary* from $R(x)$ where $R$ is a truly random function (with a random truth table) from $\\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^n$.",
