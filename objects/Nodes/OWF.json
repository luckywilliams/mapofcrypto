    "long_description": "A function $f$ is one-way if there is a polynomial-time function that, given $x$, computes $f(x)$, but there is no polynomial-time adversary A that can win the $Invert$ game with non-negligible probability.  The $Invert$ game has a gamemaster choose an $n$-bit $x$, and compute $y = f(x)$.  The adversary is given $1^n$ and y, and outputs $x'$, and wins if $f(x') = y$."
