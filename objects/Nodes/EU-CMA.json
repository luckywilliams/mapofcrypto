    "long_description": "A signature scheme $S = (Gen, Sign, Ver)$ is existentially-unforgeable under chosen message attack if there is no polynomial-time adversary $A$ that can win the $Forgery$ game with non-negligible probability.  In the $Forgery$ game, the gamemaster runs $Gen \\rightarrow (pk, sk)$ and then gives $A$ oracle access to $Sign_{sk}$.  Eventually, $A$ will output a challenge message-signature pair $m^\\star, \\sigma^\\star$, and $A$ wins the game if $Ver_{pk}(m^\\star, \\sigma^\\star)$ returns $Accept$ (and $m^\\star$ was not queried to the $Sign_{pk}$ oracle)."
