    "long_description": "If pseudorandom generators exist, then pseudorandom functions exist.  Starting with a PRG $G : \\{0,1\\}^n \\rightarrow \\{0,1\\}^{2n}$.  Define $G_0(x)$ as the left $n$ output bits and $G_1(x)$ as the right $n$ output bits of $G(x)$.  Let $x_1, x_2, \\ldots, x_n$ be the bits of $x$, the input to the PRF.  Define $f_k(x_1 x_2 \\cdots x_n)$ and $G_{x_n}(\\cdotsG_{x_2}(G_{x_1}(k)))$.  If a probabilistic poly-time adversary could break the pseudorandomness, then it must have been able to distinguish at least one application of $G$ from pseudorandom.",
